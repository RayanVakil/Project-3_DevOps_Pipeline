# Project-3_DevOps_Pipeline
DevOps pipeline integrating git, jenkins, aws, docker, ansible, kubernetes, and spinnaker. 

I personally mostly worked on the kubernetes team and helped out a bit with the spinnaker side.  

But I have finished a course recently where I learned how to create a DevOps pipeline from start to finish on my own using most of the same technologies.  The certificate will be on my linkedin soon.
